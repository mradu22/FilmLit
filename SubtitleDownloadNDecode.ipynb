01:00:56,115\\r\\nI\\'ve seen princes made and unmade\\r\\npretty fast in my time.\\r\\n\\r\\n912\\r\\n01:00:56,374 --> 01:00:58,148\\r\\nBut never with a speed like this.\\r\\n\\r\\n913\\r\\n01:00:59,779 --> 01:01:01,045\\r\\nGo ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\n914\\r\\n01:01:01,094 --> 01:01:03,548\\r\\nThe accusers may speak one at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\n915\\r\\n01:01:07,549 --> 01:01:08,652\\r\\nQuiet.\\r\\n\\r\\n916\\r\\n01:01:08,757 --> 01:01:10,676\\r\\nI have heard the accusations.\\r\\n\\r\\n917\\r\\n01:01:11,155 --> 01:01:13,677\\r\\nAnd what has his highness\\r\\nof Hassir to say?\\r\\n\\r\\n918\\r\\n01:01:13,966 --> 01:01:15,433\\r\\nAnd what of the magician?\\r\\n\\r\\n919\\r\\n01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:17,217\\r\\nCan he juggle his way out of this?\\r\\n\\r\\n920\\r\\n01:01:20,258 --> 01:01:21,457\\r\\nCome, speak.\\r\\n\\r\\n921\\r\\n01:01:21,936 --> 01:01:25,975\\r\\nMilord, when the trick fails, when it\\'s\\r\\nexposed, the magician\\'s a poor thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n922\\r\\n01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:33,294\\r\\nThe other gift, the bracelet\\r\\nyou gave the princess, milord.\\r\\n\\r\\n923\\r\\n01:01:33,504 --> 01:01:35,931\\r\\nOh, no, hang it around your neck again.\\r\\n\\r\\n924\\r\\n01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:38,099\\r\\nI did enjoy you.\\r\\n\\r\\n925\\r\\n01:01:38,147 --> 01:01:40,670\\r\\nYou surprised a man\\r\\npretty hard to surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n926\\r\\n01:01:46,368 --> 01:01:48,516\\r\\nAnd you remember poor Abdul?\\r\\n\\r\\n927\\r\\n01:01:48,545 --> 01:01:49,360\\r\\nYes.\\r\\n\\r\\n928\\r\\n01:01:49,382 --> 01:01:50,287\\r\\nYou know the law.\\r\\n\\r\\n929\\r\\n01:01:50,334 --> 01:01:53,394\\r\\nIf a man steals, you cut off his hands\\r\\nin front of his victims.\\r\\n\\r\\n930\\r\\n01:01:53,571 --> 01:01:54,924\\r\\nMy hands!\\r\\n\\r\\n931\\r\\n01:01:55,249 --> 01:01:57,168\\r\\nActually, you\\'ll cut my heart out.\\r\\n\\r\\n932\\r\\n01:01:58,405 --> 01:02:02,223\\r\\nIf a man knows the law,\\r\\nhe should think of that before he steals\\r\\n\\r\\n933\\r\\n01:02:02,271 --> 01:02:03,288\\r\\nMilord!\\r\\n\\r\\n934\\r\\n01:02:04,036 --> 01:02:07,038\\r\\nIt is no pleasure to see rare talent\\r\\ncut off before its time.\\r\\n\\r\\n935\\r\\n01:02:07,096 --> 01:02:09,724\\r\\nBut it is so written in the law.\\r\\nThere can be no compromise.\\r\\n\\r\\n936\\r\\n01:02:12,237 --> 01:02:13,340\\r\\nWhat is it?\\r\\n\\r\\n937\\r\\n01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,391\\r\\nA message from the imperial palace.\\r\\n\\r\\n938\\r\\n01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,515\\r\\nI have come from the all highest\\r\\nof the center of the

royal guard.\\r\\n\\r\\n941\\r\\n01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:31,958\\r\\nHis serene highness is thus assured that\\r\\nyou will be conducted to his presence\\r\\n\\r\\n942\\r\\n01:02:31,993 --> 01:02:33,818\\r\\nin a manner befitting\\r\\nyour exulted position\\r\\n\\r\\n943\\r\\n01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:35,426\\r\\nand the distinction of your house.\\r\\n\\r\\n944\\r\\n01:02:35,968 --> 01:02:37,887\\r\\nDid you say royal guard?\\r\\n\\r\\n945\\r\\n01:02:38,135 --> 01:02:40,054\\r\\nBy the express orders of the caliph.\\r\\n\\r\\n946\\r\\n01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:42,951\\r\\nYour palace is now completely surrounded\\r\\nby your escort.\\r\\n\\r\\n947\\r\\n01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:44,208\\r\\nMilord.\\r\\n\\r\\n948\\r\\n01:02:47,104 --> 01:02:48,773\\r\\nMilord, shall we proceed?\\r\\n\\r\\n949\\r\\n01:02:51,487 --> 01:02:54,451\\r\\nWhat are we waiting for?\\r\\nCut off his hands and dismiss the court.\\r\\n\\r\\n950\\r\\n01:02:54,485 --> 01:02:57,027\\r\\nMilord, wait, these hands\\r\\ncan serve you.\\r\\n\\r\\n951\\r\\n01:02:57,053 --> 01:02:58,194\\r\\nSilence, mountebank.\\r\\n\\r\\n952\\r\\n01:02:58,242 --> 01:03:01,015\\r\\nBut I can tell you of my master in Morocco.\\r\\n\\r\\n953\\r\\n01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:03,017\\r\\nHe toppled the king off the throne.\\r\\n\\r\\n954\\r\\n01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:04,485\\r\\nWhen everything else had failed.\\r\\n\\r\\n955\\r\\n01:03:04,561 --> 01:03:05,683\\r\\nHalt.\\r\\n\\r\\n956\\r\\n01:03:13,463 --> 01:03:14,661\\r\\nMy friend,\\r\\n\\r\\n957\\r\\n01:03:15,132 --> 01:03:17,607\\r\\nyour story will have to be\\r\\nexceedingly good.\\r\\n\\r\\n958\\r\\n01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,156\\r\\nOr it will be exceedingly short.\\r\\n\\r\\n959\\r\\n01:03:19,187 --> 01:03:21,106\\r\\nIt\\'s both, milord. It\\'s good and short.\\r\\n\\r\\n960\\r\\n01:03:21,154 --> 01:03:21,978\\r\\nBut...\\r\\n\\r\\n961\\r\\n01:03:22,403 --> 01:03:23,976\\r\\nI need my hands to tell it.\\r\\n\\r\\n962\\r\\n01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:29,913\\r\\nAnd now, what did your master\\r\\nof Morocco do?\\r\\n\\r\\n963\\r\\n01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:32,474\\r\\nWhile the king was amazed\\r\\nat the lightning in one hand,\\r\\n\\r\\n964\\r\\n01:03:32,522 --> 01:03:33,932\\r\\nthe other drove a dagger\\r\\nthrough his heart.\\r\\n\\r\\n965\\r\\n01:03:34,047 --> 01:03:35,150\\r\\nProceed.\\r\\n\\r\\n966\\r\\n01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:38,881\\r\\nI heard the king\\'s messenger.\\r\\nThe words sounded fair but...\\r\\n\\r\\n967\\r\\n01:03:39,131 --> 01:03:41,050\\r\\nYour lordship is trapped.\\r\\n\\r\\n968\\r\\n01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:44,435\\r\\nBefore the mosque this morning,\\r\\na mans\\' head rolled in the gutter.\\r\\n\\r\\n969\\r\\n01:03:44,483 --> 01:03:46,402\\r\\nHe\\'d fumbled his job.\\r\\n\\r\\n970\\r\\n01:03:46,882 --> 01:03:49,931\\r\\nYou told me yourself how much\\r\\nthe caliph loved you.\\r\\n\\r\\n971\\r\\n01:03:50,392 --> 01:03:53,625\\r\\nOf course, you know you\\'ve just written\\r\\nyour death warrant.\\r\\n\\r\\n972\\r\\n01:03:53,673 --> 01:03:54,968\\r\\nUnless I can serve you.\\r\\n\\r\\n973\\r\\n01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:58,305\\r\\nWhat you want done in Baghdad today,\\r\\nonly these hands can do.\\r\\n\\r\\n974\\r\\n01:04:22,631 --> 01:04:25,873\\r\\nGet me before the king today and you\\r\\nwill rule the empire by sundown.\\r\\n\\r\\n975\\r\\n01:04:25,921 --> 01:04:28,299\\r\\n- You have courage, my friend.\\r\\n- I have for this, milord.\\r\\n\\r\\n976\\r\\n01:04:28,568 --> 01:04:30,304\\r\\nI\\'m keeping a golden promise.\\r\\n\\r\\n977\\r\\n01:04:30,545 --> 01:04:31,887\\r\\nI\\'d rather die than break it.\\r\\n\\r\\n978\\r\\n01:04:31,973 --> 01:04:33,653\\r\\n- A promise to whom?\\r\\n- To my daughter, milord.\\r\\n\\r\\n979\\r\\n01:04:34,285 --> 01:04:36,415\\r\\nDear to me beyond the hopes of Paradise.\\r\\n\\r\\n980\\r\\n01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:39,561\\r\\nThe highest place in the world I\\'ve\\r\\npromised her since she was a baby.\\r\\n\\r\\n981\\r\\n01:04:40,012 --> 01:04:42,956\\r\\nIf you serve me today,\\r\\nI\\'ll make you a prince of Islam,\\r\\n\\r\\n982\\r\\n01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,443\\r\\nand she can have anything she wants.\\r\\n\\r\\n983\\r\\n01:04:45,786 --> 01:04:49,988\\r\\nIf I send this peacock to Paradise\\r\\none split second later, I\\'ll be dead.\\r\\n\\r\\n984\\r\\n01:04:51,992 --> 01:04:53,910\\r\\nYou risk that, of course.\\r\\n\\r\\n985\\r\\n01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:55,407\\r\\nNow, what do you want?\\r\\n\\r\\n986\\r\\n01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:57,278\\r\\nThis and it must be done rapidly.\\r\\n\\r\\n987\\r\\n01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,838\\r\\nMy Marsinah brought here in state.\\r\\n\\r\\n988\\r\\n01:05:00,107 --> 01:05:03,148\\r\\nI must see her installed not as\\r\\none of your dancers but as queen.\\r\\n\\r\\n989\\r\\n01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,605\\r\\nAs head of your household.\\r\\n\\r\\n990\\r\\n01:05:04,654 --> 01:05:06,409\\r\\nBut what about the tiger cat?\\r\\n\\r\\n991\\r\\n01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,989\\r\\nLeave the tiger cat to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n992\\r\\n01:05:09,469 --> 01:05:11,387\\r\\nAnother assignment in magic?\\r\\n\\r\\n993\\r\\n01:05:11,522 --> 01:05:13,440\\r\\nYou met the lady\\r\\nfor only a brief moment.\\r\\n\\r\\n994\\r\\n01:05:13,516 --> 01:05:15,435\\r\\nIt was love at first sight, milord.\\r\\n\\r\\n995\\r\\n01:05:15,483 --> 01:05:16,624\\r\\nI can always tell.\\r\\n\\r\\n996\\r\\n01:05:18,533 --> 01:05:20,452\\r\\nVery well, my friend, very well.\\r\\n\\r\\n997\\r\\n01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:23,339\\r\\nYour princess Marsinah shall be\\r\\nbrought here in state.\\r\\n\\r\\n998\\r\\n01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:25,669\\r\\nAnd now some wine.\\r\\n\\r\\n999\\r\\n01:05:33,286 --> 01:05:35,012\\r\\nThat means good things.\\r\\n\\r\\n1000\\r\\n01:05:35,060 --> 01:05:36,979\\r\\nLike a bursting sunrise.\\r\\n\\r\\n1001\\r\\n01:05:37,986 --> 01:05:39,905\\r\\nYou\\'ve heard many fables, child.\\r\\n\\r\\n1002\\r\\n01:05:40,383 --> 01:05:42,302\\r\\nBut the sands never lie.\\r\\n\\r\\n1003\\r\\n01:05:43,646 --> 01:05:45,007\\r\\nWhat\\'s that?\\r\\n\\r\\n1004\\r\\n01:05:47,002 --> 01:05:48,921\\r\\nHave you risen from the dead?\\r\\n\\r\\n1005\\r\\n01:05:49,113 --> 01:05:53,007\\r\\nMarsinah, my child,
